Children with ADD have a hard time focusing on things like school work, but they can concentrate on things they enjoy doing like playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation. These children tend to get into a lot of trouble, because they \"\"engage in risky behaviors, get into fights, and challenge authority\"\" in order to stimulate their brain, since their brain can not be stimulated by normal methods. ADD affects relationships with other peers because other children can not understand why they act the way that they do or why they spell they way they do or that their maturity level is different.\""}, {"src": "Upami diajar anu dumasar proyék kedahna ngajantenkeun diajar langkung gampil sareng menarik, ngabangun perancah langkung maju deui.

In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces take control of Taiwan’s western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885. In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which rules the island until 1945."}, {"src": "Ieu disebatna pH kimia. anjeun tiasa ngadamel panunjuk nganggo jus kol beureum.

Scientists say this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside. The find also grants insight into the evolution of feathers in birds. Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers inferred the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development that these other features. The feathers' structure suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not a chick's down.
