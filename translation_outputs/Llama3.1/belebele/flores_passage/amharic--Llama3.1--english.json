These subfields are often used in combination to create intelligent systems that can perform tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. AI has a wide range of applications, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. AI is also used in the development of autonomous vehicles, which are vehicles that can drive themselves without human intervention.

Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior. Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face. Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real life problems. The AI ​​system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as has been built in several home computer and video game software applications."}, {"src": "የConvergent thinking አካሄዶች ችግሮችን የመፍታት ቴክኒኮች ሲሆኑ የተለያዩ ሀሳቦች ወይም መስኮችን አንድ በማድረግ መፍትሄ መፈለግ ነው። የዚህ አስተሳሰብ ትኩረት ፍጥነት፣ አመክንዮ እና ትክክለኛነት፣ እንዲሁም ደግሞ እውነታዎችን መለየት፣ የቆዩ ቴክኒኮችን እንደገና ስራ ላይ ማዋል እና መረጃ መሰብሰብ ነው። የዚህ አስተሳሰብ በጣም ጠቃሚው ምክንያት: አንድ ብቻ ትክክለኛ መልስ መኖሩ ነው። እርስዎ ሊያስቡት የሚችሉት ሁለት መልስ ብቻ ሲሆን እሱም ትክክለኛ ወይም የተሳሳተ የሚለው ነው። ይህ ዓይነቱ አስተሳሰብ ከተወሰኑ የሳይንስ ወይም መደበኛ ሂደቶች ጋር ይያያዛል፡፡ እንደዚህ ዓይነት አስተሳሰብ ያላቸው ሰዎች የማገናዘብ አስተሳሰብ አላቸው እናም ድግግሞሾችን አስተውለው ችግሮችን ይፈታሉ፣ እና ሳይንሳዊ ፈተናዎች ላይ ይሠራሉ።", "mt": "Convergent thinking is a type of problem solving that involves finding a single correct answer.

Resting on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world. In fact, it is not easy to find at all even if one knew it existed.

However, for small cars, the cost of maintaining a car on the road is less than the cost of replacing it, so new methods of depreciation have been developed. A large number of car owners means that there are high levels of accidents on the road, which is a problem that has been caused by the speed of technological change, not by the technology itself.

This is becoming less of an issue as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production. This has allowed zoom lenses to produce pictures of a quality comparable to that achieved by lenses with fixed focal length. Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is usually lower.
